        <p>Pivoting is one of the first things I teach in my intro class. Those who grasp the rythmn of the pivot are a little more uninhibited..more free with their movement. The ones who over think the pivot can't seem to connect the dots. Messing up even in the slightest throws them off.</p> <br>
